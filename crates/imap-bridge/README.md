# huliho-imap-bridge

Translates JMAP Mail semantics (RFC 8620, RFC 8621) to IMAP4rev2
(RFC 9051) and SMTP submission (RFC 6409), so the rest of Huliho only
speaks JMAP.

The first piece is the credential check at add time. `verify` connects
to an IMAP server, signs in with a password or an OAuth token, reads the
capabilities and logs out; `smtp::verify` does the same against the
submission server with EHLO and AUTH, so a mailbox that refuses SMTP
AUTH is caught before anything is stored. Both connections use TLS from
the first byte or upgrade with STARTTLS before any credential is sent;
a server that does not offer STARTTLS is refused, never spoken to in
plaintext. Certificates are validated against the trust the caller
hands in and nothing else. The caller resolves the host and checks the
addresses; the bridge connects to them in order and resolves nothing
itself. Every step runs within one timeout. No error carries the
credential or the server's own words. The session layer sits behind one
narrow trait, so the client library can be swapped in one module.

Other software reuses the bridge by running it as its own process and
speaking JMAP to it. Linking the crate into a program instead creates a
combined work, which must ship under the AGPL (see LICENSE and NOTICE).

Build and test from the workspace root: `cargo build` and
`cargo test --workspace`. `cargo test -p huliho-imap-bridge --features
live-targets` adds the tests that need the compose Dovecot.

The `test-support` feature exposes `testing`, the scripted IMAP and
SMTP servers the tests run against: a fresh certificate per server, one
answer per command and a record of every line received.
